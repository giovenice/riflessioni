How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    u can see where the differences between two large files istantly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    u can rollback to a point where everithing was working and then change the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    if u change more files at the same time to make a sw work, it can be usefull to save only when u finsh the upgrade

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    in git you want to keep track of a change in multiple file at the same time, so is better to allow saving multiple files at one time. 
    (U don't have to look at each file separately to find the right version.)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log inside a project repository, git diff id1 id2 to check differencies between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    u can always step back easily

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
